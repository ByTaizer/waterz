    '''
    Compute segmentations from an affinity graph for several thresholds.

    Passed volumes need to be converted into contiguous memory arrays. This will
    be done for you if needed, but you can save memory by making sure your
    volumes are already C_CONTIGUOUS.

    Parameters
    ----------

        affs: numpy array, float32, 4 dimensional

            The affinities as an array with affs[channel][z][y][x].

        thresholds: list of float32

            The thresholds to compute segmentations for. For each threshold, one
            segmentation is returned.

        gt  : numpy array, uint32, 3 dimensional (optional)

            An optional ground-truth segmentation as an array with gt[z][y][x].
            If given, metrics

    Returns
    -------

        Segmentations (and metrics) are returned as generator objects, and only
        computed on-the-fly when iterated over. This way, you can ask for
        hundreds of thresholds while at any point only one segmentation is
        stored in memory.

        [segmentation]

            Generator object for segmentations (numpy arrays, uint64, 3 dimensional).

        [(segmentation, metrics)]

            Generator object for tuples of segmentations and metrics, if ground-truth volume was
            given. Metrics are given as a dictionary with the keys
            'V_Rand_split', 'V_Rand_merge', 'V_Info_split', and 'V_Info_merge'.
